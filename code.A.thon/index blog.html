                <h1>what prompt up my interest</h1> 
                <p>My journey into web design began with a fascination for the internet and a curiosity about how websites are built. I remember spending countless hours exploring different websites, captivated by their design and functionality. <br>It was like uncovering a new world with every click.

                    My interest grew when I started experimenting with creating my own simple web pages. <br>I was immediately hooked by the process of combining creativity with technology to build something functional and visually appealing.<br> As I delved deeper, I took online courses, practiced coding, and explored design principles, each step fueling my passion even more.
                    
                    What truly solidified my love for web design was realizing the impact a well-designed website can have on a user’s experience. The ability to blend aesthetics with usability, and to create something that not only looks great but also works seamlessly, was incredibly rewarding.<br> That’s when I decided to turn my passion into a career, and I’ve been dedicated to honing my skills and bringing unique digital experiences to life ever since.
